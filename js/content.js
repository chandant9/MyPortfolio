<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hello! We meet again! :) Now that you know my name already, I want to start by saying thank you so much
    for taking time to visit my Portfolio. Hope you are enjoying browsing through the diffrent projects 
    that I have worked on so far. I also wrote the code for this website that you are viewing from scratch using JavaScript, CSS and HTML and I feel 
    grateful for that. I love computer programming, so if you are wondering what I may be doing right at this very
    moment then Yes-  you guessed it right! I 'm probably working on some project or scratching my head, trying to 
    figure out a solution for the problem that I may be stuck in for days. lol. Well now you know a little more about me. clap clap</p>

<p>I was born and raised in India, a small town called Darjeeling, and it is famous for its tea production and exports 
    throughout the world. Now I have moved to Canada permanently and live here with my wife. Prior to this, I was 
    working in the retail industry in the planning and buying department as Assistant Planner (last position) for 
    almost 10 years in Dubai, UAE. And though I have always been fascinated about programming, that is the place where 
    my learning journey began and I would say pandemic only boosted that learning for me. I have done a lot of online courses 
    and certifications and projects all along the way to make myself more familiar and fluent with the fundamentals of 
    programming.</p>    
<p>I started with JavaScript back in the year 2017 and then I switched between many other languages over the course of
    years like Java and Python. Hence you would see many of my projects are written in different languages and I have 
    also used many frameworks like React, Django, and Node.js. I also have a certification from Oracle as Database SQL Certified Associate which 
    I cleared in May 2023. While continously working on various side projects, I am actively looking for a job in the 
    Information Technology field as a Developer or Software Engineer and Im just yet to land that first IT job in my career as 
    I am looking for a career change. It is going to be a hard shift from Retail Planning to Software Development but I am 
    never going to give up on this dream and I will persevere and keep grinding and live to tell the story.</p>
<p>Thank you again for reading my brief history, and if you have any questions or suggestions for me please do feel free to 
    reach out to me on my email - discoverchan9@gmail.com and I would be more than happy to read/reply.</p>
